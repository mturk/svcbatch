### Ruby Examples

Inside the [ruby](ruby) directory you can find a simple
web server example and a batch file that is used as a
service wrapper.

Put `svcbatch.exe` into that directory and create
the service by typing

```cmd

> rbhttpserver.bat create

... you should see something like below ...

[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS

```

After that, start the service by typing

```no-highlight

> sc start rbhttpserver

  SC should display something like this ...

SERVICE_NAME: rbhttpserver
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
                                (NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT         : 0x1
        WAIT_HINT          : 0x1388
        PID                : 2368
        FLAGS              :

```

Get response from our web server by typing ...

```cmd

# curl -v http://localhost:8088

... This is typical output

*   Trying ::1:8088...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8088 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
